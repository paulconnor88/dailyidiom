1. ROCK CONCERT CROWD
Caption idea: "The crowd goes wild!"

NEW SORA PROMPT:
Create a 16-bit pixel art animation of a rock concert crowd going wild. Fans with their arms raised, fists pumping, some holding lighters or phones in the air. Stage lights flashing in the background. Electric, energetic atmosphere. 16-bit pixel art animation style. Chunky pixels, limited color palette (max 16 colors), clean sprite-like characters, sharp pixel edges, no anti-aliasing. Consistent character design throughout with stable anatomy. Smooth, coherent motion with no morphing or distortion. Bright, warm colors. No text, UI elements, or watermarks.
